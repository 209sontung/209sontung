### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an experienced AI Engineer with a knack for Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Considered myself as a modern-day Sherlock Holmes, training machines to see and understand the world better than Watson ever could.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on cutting-edge AI projects focused on Computer Vision and NLP.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced deep learning techniques and exploring new research papers in the field.
- 😅 Fun fact: It was a "smelly" endeavor that got me started along my journey of artificial intelligence, categorizing through garbage. Everywhere I go, I am compelled to capture photographs of the trash in the area, and it continued to haunt me for a while after the job was done. Instilled in the mindset, trash in trash out, literally.

I'm best reached via [email](209tungns@gmail.com) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/209sontung/). I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
